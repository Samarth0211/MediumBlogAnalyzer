Lets skip past the usual suspects like YouTube WhatsApp and Instagram I want to share with you some less familiar apps that have become just as essential in my daily life They may not be household names but theyre absolute gamechangers for me
PS Ill be updating this list frequently with new apps so I suggest you to save this article
I start my day with Artifact which is kind of like TikTok but for news Kevin Systrom who helped create Instagram is behind this app What I love about Artifact is how it uses AI to figure out the news Im interested in and shows me more of that stuff Theres also this neat feature where the AI can summarise articles This way I get the gist of a story without having to read the whole thing The coolest part If theres a news headline that seems clickbaity Artifact actually checks out the article and fixes the headline to be more accurate No more falling for clickbait headlines
And theres this new feature called Links It lets us share any web link like cool things I bought or articles I find interesting with others on Artifact We can chat about these links which is both fun and really handy For me Artifact is the number one app for keeping up with the news
TickTick is my goto app for staying organized and productive Its an allinone tool that combines a planner habit tracker calendar event reminder and even a focus timer One of the standout features is the builtin Pomodoro timer which is fantastic for managing work sessions and ensuring I take necessary breaks Its incredibly helpful for planning my daily tasks keeping an eye on upcoming events and maintaining or building new habits
Shortwave is the email client that has totally changed the way I handle my inbox Its not your average email app it uses AI to sort everything out for me Promotions updates newsletters and social emails  all organized without me lifting a finger It keeps the last weeks emails right up front and stores everything else for up to 90 days automatically And if you go for the premium version which costs 9 you get a whopping three years of email history Plus you can compose emails just by talking thanks to its voicetotext feature
Pocket Casts is my goto podcast player and for good reason The user interface is clean intuitive and just a pleasure to navigate But its not just about looks its got features that really enhance the listening experience The silence remover cuts down on those pauses and the voice booster makes sure I catch every word clearly Best of all Its completely adfree even in the free version which is a rarity these days Plus it keeps track of my listening stats which is a fun way to see just how much Ive listened Its the perfect podcast player for an avid podcast listener like me
Next up on my list is Pattern Its a horoscope app thats eerily accurate  or at least it seems to be Im not totally sold on astrology but I cant help but enjoy the positive vibes it sends my way sometimes Whats really neat is that you can connect with friends on the app and see how your stars align Its a fun way to check out the dynamics of your friendships and maybe get a new perspective on the bonds you share
Bundled Notes has taken the crown as my ultimate notetaking app It rocks Androids Material You design and funnily enough seems to use it even better than Googles own Keep Notes The app lets me create bundles which are like different notebooks for various categories Inside each bundle I can use tags to organize my notes almost like having folders within folders It comes with a generous 150 MB of storage but the pro version offers a massive 15 GB  thats a whole lot of space for all my notes and reminders
Speaking of reminders I can schedule notes as reminders too I can set reminders of previous class lectures right before the new class starts so I can review what I learned last time Plus it syncs instantly between devices has Kanban boards for project management and even supports rich text formatting Its my favourite notetaking app
Whenever Im feeling a bit off and need a quick health check I turn to Ada Its an app where I can input my symptoms go through a quick assessment by answering some simple questions and get an idea of what might be wrong Its pretty handy for those times when Im dealing with minor issues and just need a bit of guidance I know its not a substitute for real medical advice but for nonserious stuff its a great first step
Beeper is the ultimate communication hub for me Imagine having all your direct messages from every social media platform rolled into one app  thats what Beeper does WhatsApp Instagram LinkedIn regular SMS and even iMessage and yes thats iMessage on an Android device are all in one place Its a gamechanger for staying on top of my conversations without juggling multiple apps With Beeper I never miss a message and keep my communication streamlined and in sync
Initially Beeper and I didnt click The idea of funnelling all my DMs from different platforms into one place felt overwhelming But as I kept using it the convenience slowly won me over Still there is a lot of room for improvement and a bit of a learning curve
Showly is the app I use to keep track of the TV shows and movies Im watching Its got a nice look to it and its easy to use Plus I get a headsup from the app whenever theres a new episode of my favorite show Its pretty handy for staying on top of all the latest stuff without having to search for it
The AirVisual app is a handy tool for checking air quality It gives you realtime updates on the air pollution levels in your area which can be important for your health The app also provides forecasts so you can plan your outdoor activities accordingly You can even set alerts to notify you when air quality becomes unhealthy Overall its a useful app to help you stay informed and make decisions to protect your wellbeing
Caffeine is one of those simple yet brilliant apps that solve a very specific problem Weve all been there reading an article or copying notes from our phone and the screen dims or locks after 10 15 or 30 seconds Its a small annoyance but it adds up Thats where Caffeine comes in It sits quietly in the quick settings of my phone and with just a tap my screen stays awake for as long as I need it to No more constant tapping to keep the phone from locking And once Im done another tap turns it off Its the kind of efficiency I love in an app
Well this one is a very wellknown app but I felt its worth mentioning Splitwise is an absolute lifesaver when it comes to managing shared expenses Whether its splitting a restaurant bill rent or even just tallying up costs for a group trip this app takes the awkwardness out You simply enter the expenses and it does the math to figure out who owes what to whom Its very helpful for roommates travel buddies and anyone who finds themselves frequently divvying up costs The interface is userfriendly and it sends out friendly reminders
Lens Distortion is an incredible app to add effects to your photos It offers a range of effects like smoke flare sunlight and even rain The presets provided within the app are very good too
Mimo is a fun and interactive app thats all about learning to code on the go It breaks down programming into bitesized lessons that I can do anytime anywhere Whether Im waiting in line or on my lunch break I can pick up my phone and learn a bit of Python or HTML Its set up like a game so it actually makes learning a new skill pretty enjoyable Ive been using it to brush up on my coding skills and its been a great way to stay sharp and even learn some new tricks
SkyView isnt exactly a musthave app for everyone but its definitely a good to have on your phone especially if you enjoy looking up at the night sky It turns your phone into a handheld guide to the stars letting you identify constellations planets and more just by pointing your camera skyward While it might not be something you use every day its incredibly cool for those nights when the sky is clear and youre curious about whats twinkling above you
Pocket is a fantastic app for when you come across an article or a video online that you dont have time to check out immediately With just a click you can save it to Pocket and come back to it later even when youre offline Its not just a bookmarking tool its like having a personal reading list thats always with you
Pocket isnt just for reading its also perfect for listening If I find an article I want to save for later Pocket can turn it into an audio version almost like a podcast which is great for when Im on the move Whether Im commuting or just out for a walk I can listen to the articles Ive saved Its like having a personal radio show of all the things Im interested in This feature makes Pocket a standout app because I can catch up on my saved articles without having to stare at my screen
Before Artifact came along Feedly was my goto for latest news Its got a lot in common with Artifact  both apps let me follow news feeds save articles for later and categorize them however I like But Feedlys been doing this for a while and its got a few tricks of its own like giving me suggestions for new stuff to read and letting me search for articles with just a keyword Its a solid choice if you want to keep all your reading in one organized place
Raindrop Bookmark Manager is where I keep all the cool stuff I find online Its like a neat little box for my favorite links articles and videos I can sort them into folders put on some tags and find them easily later no matter what device Im using Plus I can share neat finds with my friends too Its straightforward and I love how it keeps my online content organised
IFTTT stands for If This Then That and its as cool as it sounds Its an app that lets me create certain routines or shortuts that make my apps and devices work together in ways they normally wouldnt For example if the weather forecast says rain I get a reminder to bring an umbrella It can do a lot more and the possibilities are endless Super handy for automating those little tasks and saving time It is similar to Samsungs Bixby Routines or Apples Shortcuts
Locket Widget is my easy alternative to Snapchat Its straightforward add your close friends put the widget on your home screen and youre set Photos from my friends pop up there just like snaps but its all right on my home screen  no app opening needed Its best for sharing with a small group of people Theres nothing to keep up with no streaks to maintain  just simple stressfree sharing
